# SpaceX Launch Tracker

This is a react app built with mui, typescript and a SpaceX API, to display information on all SpaceX launches from the last decade.

This is my first time coding with typescript and react as this project was put together to help upskill me as part of my apprenticeship.

## Running it on your machine

- Install **Nodejs** if not already (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Download the app onto your local device
- Run `npm install` in the terminal
- Run `npm start` in the terminal

## API Links

I used the SpaceX API found here: `https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches`
